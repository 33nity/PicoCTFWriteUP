## Challenge Statement
Can you get the flag? Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55287/) and see what you can discover.

## Other Information
* Points: 100
* Subject: Web Exploitation

## Aproach and process:
* ***1.-*** This exercise leads you into a webpage with a button. If you click the button, it redirects you into `/check.php`. This page indicates you 
that there are no guest services available at the moment.

* ***2.-*** I went into the page source and found a java script called ***guest.js***, this contains a function which itâ€™s called when the button is pressed. I 
navigated to this script and saw it contains the function `continueAsGuest()` with a variable called `isAdmin` that set the document cookie to `0` by default. This variable is 
a ***boolean*** one so it needs to be changed to `1` in order to set the value `isAdmin` to ***True*** and get the flag.

* ***3.-*** I clicked on ***Continue as a guest*** button and intercept the request, then change the cookie value from `0` to `1` and forwarded it with `Burp Suite`.

* ***4.-*** Finally I was redirected to `/check.php` again but this time I could see and copy the flag to solve this challenge.
