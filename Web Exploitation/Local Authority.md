## Other Information
* Points: 100
* Subject: Web Exploitation

## Aproach and process:
* ***1.-*** The link leads you into a login page.

* ***2.-*** I inspected the page and found a ***.php*** file called `login.php`, I went to the source of that file.

* ***3.-***  In `login.php` source file there is a java script file called `secure.js`. I clicked it and went to see the source of that file.

* ***4.-*** This script has a function with a conditional that checks the username and password in order to login. The username and password are in plaintext, 
so I was able to read it and use it as login credentials to obtain the flag.
