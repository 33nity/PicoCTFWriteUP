## Challenge Statement
Can you get the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:49700/). We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but 
the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?


## Other Information
* Points: 100
* Subject: Web Exploitation

## Aproach and process:
* ***1.-*** This exercise gives you a website and some instructions in order to get the flag:

    • The flag is stored into `/usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt`.
    
    • The website is filtering ***absolute file paths***.

* ***2.-*** The website has an input field which reads the document you indicate, but it filters absolute paths. This means I got to get the flag 
accessing the indicated directory but with ***relative paths***.

* ***3.-*** Knowing this I used the next line: `../../../../flag.txt` as a relative path for the absolute path of `/usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt`.

* ***4.-*** Finally, I pressed ***Read*** button to search and read the flag.
