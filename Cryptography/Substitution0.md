## Challenge Statement
A message has come in but it seems to be all scrambled. Luckily it seems to have the key at the beginning. Can you crack this substitution cipher? Download the message [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/379/message.txt).
## Other Information
* Points: 100
* Subject: Cryptography, Substituton

## Aproach and process:
 * ***1.-*** I downloaded the file and searched for a tool online. It's a substitution challenge so I search for frequency analysis tool online and found [this one](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~awilson/tools/frequency_analysis.html). This is the tool I'm going to be using futher on this exercise.
### Quick didactic break:
* Why frecuency analysis?

In cryptanalysis, frequency analysis (also known as counting letters) is the study 
the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext. 
The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers. 
In this case the challenge is to crack a substitution cipher which is a classical one.

* ***2.-*** Knowing that picoCTF flag format is *picoCTF{flag}* I could know that the letters `F, X, S, L, P and T` would correspond to `p, i, c, o, t, and f`.

* ***3.-*** By doing these with each letter I could easily guess the other correspondences and get the flag.
